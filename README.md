# Advent of Code 2024

My first attempt at learning [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) via
the[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

The code here is in no way great, it's all me stumbling through
the docs, AI chats and friends.

Using the [aoc](https://github.com/lud/aoc) helpers for fetching
inputs and generating files and tests.
